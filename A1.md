# Assignment1 Virtual Vending Machine

<img src="1.jpg">

## The main learning objectives for this assignment are:

1. Correctly create and use variables.
2. Learn how to build expressions containing different type of operators.
3. Get familiar with string concatenation.
4. Correctly use System.out.println() to display information.
5. Understand the difference between inputs to a function and inputs to a program (received from the user through the Scanner).
6. Correctly use and manipulate inputs received by the program from the Scanner.
7. Correctly use simple conditional statements.
8. Correctly deâ€€ne and use simple functions.

## Requirements

For this part of the assignment you will write a program that simulate a virtual vending machine. Your program must retrieve inputs from a user interacting with the vending machine. The purpose of the program is to compute the amount of change to be returned by the machine given the amount of money inserted by the user and the cost of the item they have chosen. Assume that the change will be composed of **toonies ($2)**, **loonies ($1)**, **quarters ($0.25)**, **dimes ($0.10)**, and **nickels ($0.05)**.

**Note that, to be considered correct, your program must provide the user with the most convenient exact change (i.e. the exact amount with the fewest coins).**

To achieve this, you are given a template code called *VendingMachine.java*. At the beginning of the file, create five static variables indicating the amount of coins available in the vending machine. The machine has a total of $25 distributed as follows:

1. $10 in toonies
2. $5 in loonies
3. $5 in quarters
4. $3 in dimes
5. $2 in nickels

The five static variables **must be** called with the following names: TOONIES, LOONIES, QUARTERS, DIMES, and NICKELS.

For full marks, all the following functions must be part of your program:

1. 

```java
public static void displayMenu()
```

This function takes no input and displays a welcoming message as well as a list with all the options available to the customer. That is,

```
Welcome to the Lumist virtual Vending Machine.
Here are your options:
1. Candy bar $2.95
2. Cookies $3.90
3. Soda $4.00
4. Chips $3.90
5. No snacks for me today!
```

2. 

```java
public static int getSnackPrice(int choice)
```

This function takes an integer and input representing the choice of the customer after seeing the menu. The function returns the price (in cents) associated to the choice made. If the input is not a number between 1 and 4 (both included) then the function returns 0.

Example:

```java
>>> System.out.println(getSnackPrice(2))
390
>>> System.out.println(getSnackPrice(21))
0
```

3. 

```java
public static int getNumOfCoins(int amountNeeded, int valueOfCoin, int coinsAvailable)
```

This function takes three positive integers as input, the first indicating the amount of money needed (in cents), the second indicating the value of a coin (in cents), and the third indicating the number of coins of the given value available in the machine. The function returns the maximum number of coins of the given value that can be used to work toward achieving the target amount.

Example:

```java
>>> getNumOfCoins(1000, 100, 8)
8
>>> getNumOfCoins(550, 200, 4)
2
>>> getNumOfCoins(234, 30, 20)
7
```

4. 

```java
public static boolean computeAndDisplayChange(int change)
```

This function takes as input one non-negative integer representing the change (in cents) that the vending machine should give back to the customer. Using the coins available in the machine, the method computes the most convenient exact change. If the machine has enough coins to make the change, then the function displays the corresponding information on the screen and returns True. Otherwise, the function must not display anything and returns False.

Example:

```java
>>> boolean b = computeAndDisplayChange(185)
Here is your change:
toonies x 0
loonies x 1
quarters x 3
dimes x 1
nickels x 0
>>> System.out.println(b)
true
```

5. 

```java
public static void operateMachine()
```

This function takes no inputs and returns no value. The function performs the following tasks in this following order:

1. It displays the menu of the vending machine
2. It retrieves an integer from the user indicating their choice
3. If no snack item was chosen, then it displays a goodbye message and terminate its execution. Otherwise, it displays the price (in cents) of the chosen item and continues to the next step.
4. It retrieves the cash (in dollars) provided by the user.
5. It rounds the amount provided by the user to two decimals (round down) and displays it (in cents).
6. If the amount provided if not a multiple of 5 then it displays a message indicating that no pennies are accepted and terminates its execution.
7. If the amount provided is not enough to cover the price of the snack, then it displays a messages indicating that the cash is not enough and terminates its execution.
8. It displays the change (in cents) that the user should expect from the machine
9. It computes and displays the change to be provided. If it was not possible to provide the change needed, it displays a message indicating that the machine does not have enough coins. Otherwise, it displays a message indicating the order was successfully processed.

Insert your money : $
4
You inserted 400 cents
Here is your change:
Toonies x 0
Loonies x 0
Quarters x 0

```

For full credit you should never be repeating code, but rather calling helper functions! You are welcome to add additional functions if you think this can increase the readability of your code.
